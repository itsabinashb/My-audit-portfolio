### *Hey there, this is Abinash aka itsabinashb. I am smart contract security researcher with 1+ years of experience. I am skilled in auditing different kind of defi protocols like lending-borrowing, staking, perpetuals & any kind of solidity smart contracts. I have also worked as a soldity developer before starting my auditing career which gave me a strong base in auditing. Below are few of my audit works with report link.*
